* Usage

Storage in an environment variable can be done in two ways:
1. as a string that is parsable by ~JSON.parse~
2. as a Base-64 encoded string that decodes to a ~JSON.parse~-parsable
   string

** Node environment

To require a configuration that is stored in one of the files
- =config/my-color.json=
- =config/my-color.js=
or the environment variable =MY_COLOR= (note, a dash becomes an
underscore and everything is in uppercase):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
const Colors = require('apparts-config').get('my-color');
#+END_SRC


** Webpack for web environment

To require a configuration that is stored in the environment variable
=MY_COLOR= (note, a dash becomes an underscore and everything is in
uppercase):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
const Colors = require('apparts-config').get('my-color');
#+END_SRC
